# Problem Statement

**Child care**, also known as **day care**, is the care and supervision of one or more children, typically ranging from two weeks to 18 years old.[^1] It refers to the care of children especially as *a service while parents are working*.[^2] This service is important for children as they need professional care while their parents are working. 

Areas where there are too few licensed slots for the number of children who need care are known as **child care deserts**, and more than half of Americaâ€™s children live in one.[^3] To address this issue, the government has announced substantial grants to help child care providers maintain their services and expand their operations. For example, **New York State** (NYS) identified **$100M** to build and expand child care capacity in areas with the least supply.[^4]

## Problem A
Let's assume the NYS government would like to eliminate **child care deserts** in New York State. In particular, an area is defined as a child care deserts *if* 
$$ c \geq \frac{1}{3} p $$
where $c$ denotes the available capacity in this area and $p$ denotes the population of children ranging from two weeks to 18 years old.
