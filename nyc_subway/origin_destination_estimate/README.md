This dataset provides an estimate of subway travel patterns based on scaled-up OMNY and MetroCard return swipe data. It provides estimated passenger volumes for all populated origin-destination (O-D) pairs aggregated by month, day of the week, and hour of day. It also provides the name, ID, and approximate latitude and longitude of the origin and destination subway complexes.
