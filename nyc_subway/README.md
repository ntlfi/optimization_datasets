# Problem Statement

NYC Subway is a rapid transit system owned by the City of New York and leased to the New York City Transit Authority, a subsidiary agency of the state-run **Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)**. It is one of the oldest and largest public transportation systems in the world, with **472** stations in operation. The subway system is the **most** used rapid transit system in the United States and the **seventh most** used rapid transit system in the world.[^1]

Given the large amount of traffic in the subway system, it is important to understand the capacity of the subway system available to the public. Intuitively, the available capacity of the subway system is determined by the number of trains running on the tracks and the numbers of passengers already in the system. Thanks to MTA Open Data Program[^2], we have access to high quality data that can help us understand the capacity of the subway system.
